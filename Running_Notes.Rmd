Thesis Plans
##
JP paper is about trophic levels and pigments

##
Claire working on surface sediment calibration 

##
One paper looking at full spectrum and machine learning patterns to try and pull out useful information

-Start learning machine learning techniques
##
Another paper looking at other possible spectral indices (RABDs,etc. )
Quantify uncertainty on these using lab data

##
for now, surface sediments correlations with instrumental data

##
tidyverse universe

#pigment samples 
pulled from disc in later, same as JP data set
#surface sediments
same but surface specific
#bulk samples



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
